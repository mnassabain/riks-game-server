Standardized data model
Everything is fixed now, this document just needs better formatting
Also some commenting will be added


1. Static Data
/*************/

// Map object should be made to be easily instancied from a text file or another type with a pre-defined format, and available to all games currently using that map
---
Map

String name
list struct Continent continents[C]
list struct Territory territories[T]



----------------
struct Continent
----------------
in id
int bonus
int firstTerritory
int lastTerritory

struct Territory
----------------
int id
list int neighbors[X]



2. Dynamic Data
/**************/

----
Game

Map map // reference to used map

list TerritoryState board[T] // Board state, territories occupation, as defined in the first document, using map to calculate and declare size?
int tokens[4] // Drawing pool, individual player tokens will be in their player object, cleaner that way, I think?
int totalExchangedSets // See question in first document
list Player players[P]
int activePlayer
int phase -1 - 2
bool territoryCapture // Gotta find a more eloquent name

struct TerritoryState

int owner
int units

// Recorded individual data (during this game) that could be used to record stats at the end of the game could be stored here, here are some examples
